Summary of Project: This project is a prototype of a shared diary, where users can write an online
diary together and look at each others' diaries. Currently, the functionalities of this diary are
1. writing and saving an entry and 2. looking at what entries are stored on the database

Frontend - React.js
Backend - MySQL

Links I referred to:

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-a-paint-app-in-reactjs/
However, this was not completely copy and pasted - I still fixed a couple buggy features
and implemented touch features for stylus users, and added the option to switch
between text and drawing modes. 

Notes:
React Paradigm --> pass data down from parent to children, pass actions up so they get executed in parent
